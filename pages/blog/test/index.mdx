Hullo, and welcome to a new age, the age of the Aquarius. The day henceforth my new <Sparkles>blog</Sparkles> came into existence, screaming might I add.

This journey for a new blog started in November of last year (2021) and before that even in (2018) when I wanted to create my own portfolio (https://hghazniv4.netlify.app/). It's been a busy year in the Ashton household; we've renovated a house, we've had a baby, I've got a new job and created more video content on the YouTubez.

Though here we are nearly a year on seeing the blog take it very first baby steps with a complete shitpost. Speaking of babies... did I mention I had one of those? Genuinely, a horribly, life-affirming, beautiful experience that gave to me, my wife and Earth one of the greatest people I know... my little boy Charlie.

I say that because having a child can have multiple affects on a person. For me, it's made me value my spare time and output a lot more. Not just that, it makes you think what do you actually want out of life and what do you want to achieve from your time in this industry or just on this planet?

One of those outputs for me is to have a home for content that doesn't always necessarily need to live in video form. Putting every idea you want to share in video format can be quite limiting. Adding a blog as another output allows me to put my ideas down faster and it's a great staging ground for potential future videos.

Though I don't want to do just any ordinary blog. I want to make it unique to me and have it so that I'm in control of the data/code. For example I can create fun components like this for my blog.

<CodeSnippet language="jsx" exampleCode={
`<h1>test</h1>`
} />

And this.

<Playground defaultEditorTab="markup" id="test"   
markup={`
<div class="wrapper">
  <h2>Hello World</h2>
</div>
  `}
  cssCode={`
.wrapper {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
}
\n\
body {
  height: 100vh;
  background: silver;
}`}
javaScript={`
console.log('test');
`} />

Is committing myself to another project and or competitor for my time a terrible decision post fatherhood? Possibly, but I wouldn't be in this industry if I wasn't constantly ready to pull the trigger on adding another thing to juggle.

Welcome to my blog. Welcome to the Age of Aquarius.
